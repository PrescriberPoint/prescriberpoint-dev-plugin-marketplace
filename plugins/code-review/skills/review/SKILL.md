Review the code I've selected or the recent changes for:
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Security concerns (HIPAA compliance, PHI handling)
- Performance issues
- Code readability and maintainability
- Adherence to PrescriberPoint coding standards

Be concise and actionable. Prioritize issues by severity.
